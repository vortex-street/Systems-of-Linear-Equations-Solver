# Systems-of-Linear-Equations-Solver

linear_methods.py contains 6 functions for solving systems of linear equations via the Choleski method, Gauss-elimination method, Gauss-Jordan elimination method, Gauss-Seidel iteration method, and relaxation method.

linear_equations_solver.py runs one of the desired functions and also takes user input on whether to apply partial or complete pivoting. It inputs equations either manually within the script or externally from an .xls file (see input.xls).
